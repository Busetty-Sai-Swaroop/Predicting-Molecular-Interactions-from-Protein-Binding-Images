# Predicting Molecular Interactions from Protein Binding Images

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a **deep learning–based framework** for predicting **protein–ligand interactions** using **protein binding images** derived from the **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**.  
The proposed approach employs a **hybrid architecture combining 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN) and VGG16** to capture both spatial and structural features of protein–ligand complexes.

The model performs **binary classification** to determine whether a ligand **binds or does not bind** to a target protein.

## 🧬 Motivation
Protein–ligand interactions are fundamental to:
- Drug discovery  
- Molecular medicine  
- Protein engineering  

Traditional methods such as **X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, cryo-electron microscopy**, and **molecular docking** are accurate but:
- Time-consuming  
- Computationally expensive  
- Difficult to scale  

This project provides an **automated, scalable, and AI-driven alternative** using image-based deep learning techniques.

## 🏗️ Proposed Methodology
The system follows a **dual-branch hybrid architecture**:

### 🔹 3D-CNN Branch
- Input: **32 × 32 × 32 voxel grids**
- Learns fine-grained **volumetric and spatial features**
- Captures atomic-level interactions in protein binding pockets

### 🔹 VGG16 Branch (Transfer Learning)
- Input: **224 × 224 protein binding images**
- Pre-trained on PyMol
- Extracts **high-level structural and visual features**

### 🔹 Feature Fusion & Classification
- Features from both branches are concatenated
- Fully connected layers integrate information
- Output: **Binding / Non-Binding**
